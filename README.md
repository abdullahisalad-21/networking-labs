### Security Concepts Related to Networking
Today’s work focused on Windows and Linux permissions, which directly support secure network administration:

- Understanding ACLs (Access Control Lists)
- Managing user access to shared resources
- Applying least-privilege principles
- Preventing unauthorized access through correct permissions

These concepts are foundational for secure networking.
