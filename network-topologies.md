# Network Topologies

## Overview
Network topology defines how devices are connected. Understanding topologies helps with troubleshooting and design.

---

## 1. Star Topology
- Most common  
- Central switch  
- Easy to troubleshoot  

---

## 2. Mesh Topology
- Multiple redundant paths  
- High availability  
- Used in enterprise networks  

---

## 3. Hybrid Topology
- Mix of star, mesh, bus  
- Used in modern networks  

---

## 4. Bus Topology
- Legacy  
- Single backbone cable  

---

## 5. Ring Topology
- Devices connected in a loop  
- Rare today

## What I Learned
- How topologies affect performance  
- Why redundancy matters  
- How enterprise networks are structured
